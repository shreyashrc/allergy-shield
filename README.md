## 6. User Interface Design Principles

### Design Philosophy
- **Clean and minimal**: Reduce cognitive load, especially for users experiencing symptoms
- **Accessible**: Support for screen readers, sufficient contrast, flexible text sizing
- **Mobile-first**: Design for smaller screens first, then expand to desktop
- **Intuitive data entry**: Quick symptom logging with minimal steps
- **Informative visualizations**: Clear, understandable charts and correlations

### Key User Flows

#### Symptom Tracking Flow
1. Login → Dashboard → "Log Symptom" button
2. Select symptom type from visual grid
3. Set severity using slider
4. Add optional notes
5. Submit with single tap/click
